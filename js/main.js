ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

To Implement:

ui:
    3 image/icons for rock/paper/scissors
    tally counter to see win/loss ration
    get from fontawesome (hand-scissors, hand-fist, hand  )

features:    
    user clicks one icon to choose hand

    generate random selection for ai (try implement sound?)

    show rock image shake 3 times then display user and ai selection (can use transform(scale) to increase size momentarily)

    some kind of animation to show if win or lose
    add to tally counter, make winner flash green and loser flash red?
