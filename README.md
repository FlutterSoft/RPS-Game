## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The basics are standard html, css, DOM manipulation with JavaScript, also uses CSS animation to animate the fist shakes before displaying the results which changes the winner to be green and loser to be red. This is done using timeouts to get things to sync up, input is disabled until after the round completes. Also uses sound effects!  

## Optimizations

I think I could break down the functions a bit more simply, I had some issues with settimeout and things not working so I'd probably fork and make attempts at refactoring. 

## Lessons Learned:

Learning how to implement CSS animations and sound effects! First time I've done both. I was able to implement all the functionality I originally planned for.
